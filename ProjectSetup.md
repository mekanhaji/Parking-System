# To set up the Flask-based parking management system with SQLite and Bootstrap, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites:
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Flask by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install flask
```
### Install SQLite. 
SQLite is typically included with Python installations, so no additional installation is required.

### Download the Project Files:
Obtain the project files either by downloading them from a repository or by cloning the repository using Git.

### Set up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Install Dependencies:
In the project directory, install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure the Database:
In the project directory, locate the configuration file (e.g., config.py) and ensure that the database settings are correctly configured. This includes specifying the database name, location, and any other relevant settings.

### Initialize the Database:
Run the following command in your terminal to initialize the SQLite database:
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```
### Start the Application:
In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
flask run
```
The application will start, and you will see a local development server address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
Open a web browser and visit the provided address to access the parking management system.

### Explore and Test:
You can now explore the parking management system and test its various features.Create user accounts, register vehicles, reserve parking spaces, and simulate different scenarios to ensure the system functions as expected.

> Note: Remember to consult the project documentation or README file for any specific instructions or additional configuration steps.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the Flask-based parking management system with SQLite and Bootstrap. You can now customize and extend the system according to your requirements. Happy coding!
